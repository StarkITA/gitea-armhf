**The following paragraphs only apply if Packages are not globally disabled!**

## Repository-Packages

A package always belongs to an owner (a user or organisation), not a repository.
To link an (already uploaded) package to a repository, open the settings page
on that package and choose a repository to link this package to.
The entire package will be linked, not just a single version.

Linking a package results in showing that package in the repository's package list,
and shows a link to the repository on the package site (as well as a link to the repository issues).

## Access Restrictions

| Package owner type | User | Organization |
|--------------------|------|--------------|
| **read** access    | public, if user is public too; otherwise for this user only | public, if org is public, otherwise for org members only |
| **write** access   | owner only | org members with admin or write access to the org |

N.B.: These access restrictions are [subject to change](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/19270), where more finegrained control will be added via a dedicated organization team permission.

## Create or upload a package

Depending on the type of package, use the respective package-manager for that. Check out the sub-page of a specific package manager for instructions.

## View packages

You can view the packages of a repository on the repository page.

1. Go to the repository.
1. Go to **Packages** in the navigation bar.

To view more details about a package, select the name of the package.

## Download a package

To download a package from your repository:

1. Go to **Packages** in the navigation bar.
1. Select the name of the package to view the details.
1. In the **Assets** section, select the name of the package file you want to download.

## Delete a package

You cannot edit a package after you have published it in the Package Registry. Instead, you
must delete and recreate it.

To delete a package from your repository:

1. Go to **Packages** in the navigation bar.
1. Select the name of the package to view the details.
1. Click **Delete package** to permanently delete the package.

## Disable the Package Registry

The Package Registry is automatically enabled. To disable it for a single repository:

1. Go to **Settings** in the navigation bar.
1. Disable **Enable Repository Packages Registry**.

Previously published packages are not deleted by disabling the Package Registry.

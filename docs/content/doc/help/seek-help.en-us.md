# Support Options

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/Gitea)
- [Discourse Forum](https://discourse.gitea.io/)

**NOTE:** When asking for support, it may be a good idea to have the following available so that the person helping has all the info they need:

1. Your `app.ini` (with any sensitive data scrubbed as necessary).
2. The Gitea logs, and any other appropriate log files for the situation.
    - When using systemd, use `journalctl --lines 1000 --unit gitea` to collect logs.
    - When using docker, use `docker logs --tail 1000 <gitea-container>` to collect logs.
    - By default, the logs are outputted to console. If you need to collect logs from files,
      you could copy the following config into your `app.ini` (remove all other `[log]` sections),
      then you can find the `*.log` files in Gitea's log directory (default: `%(GITEA_WORK_DIR)/log`).

    ```ini
    ; To show all SQL logs, you can also set LOG_SQL=true in the [database] section
    [log]
    LEVEL=debug
    MODE=console,file
    ROUTER=console,file
    XORM=console,file
    ENABLE_XORM_LOG=true
    FILE_NAME=gitea.log
    [log.file.router]
    FILE_NAME=router.log
    [log.file.xorm]
    FILE_NAME=xorm.log
    ```

3. Any error messages you are seeing.
4. When possible, try to replicate the issue on [try.gitea.io](https://try.gitea.io) and include steps so that others can reproduce the issue.
    - This will greatly improve the chance that the root of the issue can be quickly discovered and resolved.
5. If you meet slow/hanging/deadlock problems, please report the stack trace when the problem occurs:
    1. Enable pprof in `app.ini` and restart Gitea

        ```ini
        [server]
        ENABLE_PPROF = true
        ```

    2. Trigger the bug, when Gitea gets stuck, use curl or browser to visit: `http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1` (IP must be `127.0.0.1` and port must be `6060`).
    3. If you are using Docker, please use `docker exec -it <container-name> curl "http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1"`.
    4. Report the output (the stack trace doesn't contain sensitive data)

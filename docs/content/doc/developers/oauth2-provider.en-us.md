# OAuth2 provider

**Table of Contents**

{{< toc >}}

Gitea supports acting as an OAuth2 provider to allow third party applications to access its resources with the user's consent. This feature is available since release 1.8.0.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint                 | URL                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| OpenID Connect Discovery | `/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| Authorization Endpoint   | `/login/oauth/authorize`            |
| Access Token Endpoint    | `/login/oauth/access_token`         |
| OpenID Connect UserInfo  | `/login/oauth/userinfo`             |
| JSON Web Key Set         | `/login/oauth/keys`                 |

## Supported OAuth2 Grants

At the moment Gitea only supports the [**Authorization Code Grant**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) standard with additional support of the following extensions:

- [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)
- [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth)

To use the Authorization Code Grant as a third party application it is required to register a new application via the "Settings" (`/user/settings/applications`) section of the settings.

## Scopes

Gitea supports the following scopes for tokens:

## Client types

Gitea supports both confidential and public client types, [as defined by RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.1).

For public clients, a redirect URI of a loopback IP address such as `http://127.0.0.1/` allows any port. Avoid using `localhost`, [as recommended by RFC 8252](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252#section-8.3).

## Example

**Note:** This example does not use PKCE.

1. Redirect to user to the authorization endpoint in order to get their consent for accessing the resources:

   ```curl
   https://[YOUR-GITEA-URL]/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI& response_type=code&state=STATE
   ```

   The `CLIENT_ID` can be obtained by registering an application in the settings. The `STATE` is a random string that will be send back to your application after the user authorizes. The `state` parameter is optional but should be used to prevent CSRF attacks.

   The user will now be asked to authorize your application. If they authorize it, the user will be redirected to the `REDIRECT_URL`, for example:

   ```curl
   https://[REDIRECT_URI]?code=RETURNED_CODE&state=STATE
   ```

2. Using the provided `code` from the redirect, you can request a new application and refresh token. The access token endpoints accepts POST requests with `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` body, for example:

   ```curl
   POST https://[YOUR-GITEA-URL]/login/oauth/access_token
   ```

   ```json
   {
     "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
     "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
     "code": "RETURNED_CODE",
     "grant_type": "authorization_code",
     "redirect_uri": "REDIRECT_URI"
   }
   ```

   Response:

   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJnbnQiOjIsInR0IjowLCJleHAiOjE1NTUxNzk5MTIsImlhdCI6MTU1NTE3NjMxMn0.0-iFsAwBtxuckA0sNZ6QpBQmywVPz129u75vOM7wPJecw5wqGyBkmstfJHAjEOqrAf_V5Z-1QYeCh_Cz4RiKug",
     "token_type": "bearer",
     "expires_in": 3600,
     "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJnbnQiOjIsInR0IjoxLCJjbnQiOjEsImV4cCI6MTU1NzgwNDMxMiwiaWF0IjoxNTU1MTc2MzEyfQ.S_HZQBy4q9r5SEzNGNIoFClT43HPNDbUdHH-GYNYYdkRfft6XptJBkUQscZsGxOW975Yk6RbgtGvq1nkEcklOw"
   }
   ```

   The `CLIENT_SECRET` is the unique secret code generated for this application. Please note that the secret will only be visible after you created/registered the application with Gitea and cannot be recovered. If you lose the secret you must regenerate the secret via the application's settings.

   The `REDIRECT_URI` in the `access_token` request must match the `REDIRECT_URI` in the `authorize` request.

3. Use the `access_token` to make [API requests](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/api-usage#oauth2) to access the user's resources.
